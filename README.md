# thor-landing-page

Simple landing page (TOP curriculum). I created a silly page about the norse god Thor.

Technologies used:

 <ol>
    <li style="color:orange">HTML5</li>
    <li style="color:lightskyblue">CSS3</li>
</ol>

<p>I had to create a webpage from scratch using html and css. First I created the html file, added multiple divs and started styling from top to bottom.
<br>I needed to edit both files constantly to complete the project successfully. I used Flexbox to organize the content properly and align elements.
</br>I did make a few mistakes, some of which I noticed while evaluating my work, but I decided agaisnt editing my project. It will remains as is
</br>since I want to be able to look back on my progress in a few months. :)</p>
